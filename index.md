## Welcome to Dr. Xun Liang's Pages
Xun Liang was born in Nov. 1990, Guangxi, China. He received the B.S. degree in Resources Environment and Management of Urban and Rural Planning from Shanxi University (SXU) in 2013, the M.Sc. degree in Cartography and Geography Information System from Sun-Yat Sen University (SYSU) in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in Cartography and Geography Information System from SYSU in 2018. 
Dr. Liang is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences (CUG). He has published 17 journal articles since 2016. Four papers are flagged with an ESI Hot (top 0.1%) Paper. The sum of time cited is 530, the h-index is 8. Dr. Liang is also a reviewer of some academic journals, including Land Use Policy, Science of the Total Environment, and etc. His main research interests include spatio-temporal dynamic modeling, land-use change analysis and simulation.
Dr. Liang independently developed the GeoSOS-FLUS software package for land-use change simulation (http://www.geosimulation.cn/flus.html), which has been used by scholars in many countries, including China, USA, Germany, Nigeria, India, Turkey, Cambodia and etc. Studies using FLUS model have been published in or submitted to various international journals, such as Nature Communications, Global Environment Change, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, Environmental Science & Technology, Journal of Environmental Management, Ecological Indicator, and Landscape Ecology. Dr. Liang also proposed the Mixed-cell Cellular Automata (MCCA) model and developed a MCCA software (https://github.com/HPSCIL/Mixed_Cell_Cellullar_Automata), which is fundamentally different from conventional pure-cell CA models. It enables mixed land use research to leap from static analysis to dynamic simulation and has received extensive attention from worldwide scholars. In addition, the Patch-level Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model and the Open Space Cellular Automata (OS-CA) model are forthcoming.
